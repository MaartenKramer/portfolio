      <h2>Game Designer & Game Developer</h2>
      <p>Hi! my name is Maarten and I'm currently studying Game Development at the HKU in Utrecht.
      I've always had a strong passion for all things creative. Whether it's games, music, writing, or making websites like this one!
      I usually spend my free time gaming, listening to music, or DM'ing my Dungeons and Dragons campaign. I love personal expression and am always looking for environments that allow me to do so.
      </p>

      <p>I'm a multifaceted designer with a focus on narratives, and I like taking that mindset with me while I work.
      Through interesting hooks and concepts, and iterations that build well on those elements, I am able to make fun and unique experiences.
      With the games I make I also like to tackle different genres or themes.
      So whether it's a dark haunted basement or a secret society of trash worshipping rats, if the debugging isn't too annoying, I'm having a good time!
      </p>
      
      <p>I'm always bursting with different ideas and find myself easily getting inspired by different media and the weird and wonderful people around me.

          <h1>REMEMBRANCE</h1>
          <h2>YOU SEE THEM, THEY SEE YOU</h2>
          <p>Remembrance is a reimagining of my first Unity game, The Maze, a horror stealth game. I wanted to build and expand on the horror aspects, give context to your actions, and enhance the visuals. I introduced a storyline and monster voice acting to make a more immersive experience. The monster now becomes more perceptive if the player moves or uses a flashlight and it now sports a disturbing new look.</p>

          <h1>THE RAT GAME</h1>
          <h2>A MYSTICAL TRASH UTOPIA</h2>
          <p>Through a UN-organized games event on sustainable cities, my team and I began working on a cutesy rat game about a society in a trash can. I managed to create a lot of wonder by making their world very small and adding mystique to the world outside their trashcan. I took inspiration from old legends to make this world believable. I ended up contributing a lot as the team lead and the writer to our game, and we ended up with something truly special.</p>

          <h1>BURNING MEMORY</h1>
          <h2>TRAUMA & ACCEPTANCE</h2>
          <p>As part of a seminar we were asked to make a game about coping. I ended up sharing with my team about my experience with losing my dad's home to a housefire and the indirect guilt I felt in not being there to "fix it". We ended up using this trauma as a jumping off point for a timeloop game where a character slowly has to come to terms with being unable to change the past, but being able to shape the future.</p>

          <h2>A STORY COME TO LIFE</h2>
          <p>My team and I were asked to develop a game with a real life component to it. We decided on making a story book with an Arduino portal to load in characters and items into a game version of the story. I was in charge of developing the Arduino connectivity and building puzzle and stealth systems. During A/B testing, we noticed that players struggled more with the easy puzzle than the hard one. It was a great lesson in how player assumptions can shape the experience.</p>

          <h1>KOMMANDER</h1>
          <h2>A KEEN EYE CAN SAVE LIVES</h2>
          <p>When starting at the HKU, they asked us to form a game concept around a word we had thought up prior. I had "Analyze". I thought a game where you analyze limited information in a dangerous situation would be engaging. So I developed KOMMANDER where you would guide a platoon of soldiers through enemy territory, but all in a text adventure form. You were also given one-time-use special units, which you had to deploy strategically.</p>

          <p>Our school had asked us to showcase prototypes at an exposition event. I wanted to try and make a combat system but also integrate the PSX artstyle that had enamored me for so long. The game was made in around 3 days. I ended up making all assets myself and developed a basic swordfighting system with a secondary crossbow.</p>

          <h2>DARK BEGINNINGS</h2>
          <p>Back when I studied Software Development, we were told to make a prototype game where you race an AI in a maze. I wanted to go above and beyond and truly try my hand at making a proper game. After discussing it with my teacher, I had permission to make my horror maze game. Here you would be hunted by an AI while you try to find the key to the exit. This is where my game development adventure truly began.</p>
